# Text-Based-Game
While I was cleaning my drive I found my first game that I've made in C++ using only text (ASCII). It's from 2020, so a lot of time passed since then. 
I'm more experienced now and I don't write so much spaghetti code nowadays. Anyways, I'm putting it here, safe in the archives. 

WARNING! The game might be buggy on Windows 11! Reccommended system is Windows 10.

I'll try to rewrite this project in the future, for now, it is what it is.
