# Text-Based-Game
While I was cleaning my drive I found my first game that I've made in C++ using only text (ASCII). It's from 2020, so a lot of time passed since then. 
I'm more experienced now and I don't write so much spaghetti code nowadays lol. Anyways, I'm putting it here, safe in the archives. 


WARNING! The game might be buggy on Windows 11! Reccommended system is Windows 10
